 # TODO

- Vector of channels rather than L and R (because why not)
- reduce data duplication while processing in processAudioBuffer (some of this moves to the audioProcessor class)
- Present visual betterer. for example:
  - with an axis, logarithmically, and more centered
  - interpolation to smooth movement
  - history (trails)
  - lighting
  - perspective
